#Python has a great built-in list type named "list". 
List literals are written within square brackets [ ]. 
Lists work similarly to strings -- use the len() function and square brackets [ ] 
to access data, with the first element at index 0

*access the elements of the list
*append and extend elements in list

In case you don't want your list to be modified, in this case we use tupples.
To declare a list we use square brackets, instead for tuples we use round brackets

Tuples are rarely used, but they are indeed used.

#Dictionaries are composed of key and values

"""
Each key is separated from its value by a colon (:), the items are separated by 
commas, and the whole thing is enclosed in curly braces. 
An empty dictionary without any items is written with just two curly braces, 
like this: {}.

Keys are unique within a dictionary while values may not be. 
The values of a dictionary can be of any type, 
but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.
